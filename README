#Machine Learning Practice(TensorFlow)
  I'm a Beginner of Machine Learning, this is my first project aimed to practice the Machine Leaning skills learned
  from the Net.

Environment:Python3.6(64-bit), 
  run following command to install the requirements
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  
Data:
  The Data is about football match results. All captured from the Net.(stored in Data/FootData.csv)
  
Purpose:
  The Purpose is try to use the history data to predict the footballmatch results between two teams.
  
How to run:
   Just run 
   py -3 FootBallDataPredict.py 
   This will start the training program, and save the models in the same dir.
   
Results:
   The accuracy of train_data and test_data is up to 68%, which means it is still not very possible to predict
   match result. 
   But as a program to understand and practice basic tensorflow deep leaning skills. This
   project will be more than enough.
