Machine Learning Practice(TensorFlow)
===========

  I'm a Beginner of Machine Learning, this is my first project aimed to practice the Machine Leaning skills.

# Environment: Python3.6(64-bit), 
  Pls run the following command to install the requirements.
  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
  
# Data:
  The Data is about football match results. Captured from the Net.(stored in **Data/FootData.csv**)
  
# Purpose:
  The purpose of this project is try to use the history data predict the footballmatch results between two teams in the future.
  
# How to run:
   After install the requirements, use the following command to run:
   `py -3 FootBallDataPredict.py`
   Which will start the training program, and save the models in the same dir.
   
# Results:
   The accuracy of train_data and test_data is up to 68%, which means it is still not very possible to predict
   the match result. 
   But as a program to understand and practice basic tensorflow deep leaning skills. This
   project will be more than enough.
   
# Contacts:
   If you are interested in this project, pls feel free to contact me on github, improve this project together.
